I was not able to make the images of the food to show because it kept making my crash app but it functions well now
These are the changes that i made to my application 
Everytime i put the logo the average cost doesn’t appear on the home page 

What I changed / implemented
1. App title updated to **Christoffel Cooks**.
2. Added screens: Home, Menu, AddItem (separate), Login.
3. Chef login toggles `isChef` — chef-only button to add items is hidden for guests.
4. Added Item screen accepts Dish name, Description, Course (from a predefined list), Price, and Image URL.
5. Home screen shows:
   - Total number of menu items.
   - Average prices by course (computed using loops to demonstrate learning outcomes).
   - List of menu items.
6. Menu screen allows filtering by course.
7. Items are stored in app-level state (`useState`) and updated when chef adds or removes items.
8. Styling applied using `styles.ts` with silver, grey, black text and white background.
9. Added examples of `for`, `while`, and `for...in` loops to compute averages.
10. Provided remove-last functionality
